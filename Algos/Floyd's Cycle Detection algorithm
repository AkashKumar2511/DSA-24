- Also known "Using Floyd's Tortoise and Hare algorithm"
- Approach uses two pointers : Slow, Fast
- Topics related : Graphs, linked lists


For cycle detection : 
        - Slow pointer moves by 1 steps
        - Fast pointer moves by 2 steps
        - If slow and fast pointers meet, it can be concluded that a cycle exist

To find the origin of cycle : 
        - Re-initialize the slow pointer as root node
        - Move the slow and fast pointer at same pace 
        - Slow and fast pointers meet at the origin of the cycle
