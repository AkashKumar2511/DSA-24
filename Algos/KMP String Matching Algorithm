#Knuth - Morris - Pratt String Matching Algorithm :
-------------------------------------------------

##Introduction :

*The Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) algorithm is a string searching algorithm that efficiently finds occurrences of a pattern within a text. 
*It's particularly useful when you want to find all instances of a given substring within a larger string.
