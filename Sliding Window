- Approach : Hashmap + Two Pointers
---------------------------------
Two Pointers :
1) End - Traversal pointer
2) Start - Minimum window pointer
- â‡’ Counter and var for valid window check

# Code Template

	n = len(s)
	mp = dict()
	#traversing variables
	start = end = 0
	#condition checking varaiables
	ans = -1
	
	
  while(end < n):
		  #condition check for s[end] in mp
      if(.......):
		      ........
		      .........
		      
      #loop to minimize the window using "start" pointer
      while(......condition......):
          #updating Counter and var for forwarding the start pointer
          if(.......start pointer condition check......):
		          .........
		          ........
          start += 1
      end += 1

- *One thing needs to be mentioned is that when asked to find maximum substring, 
we should update maximum after the inner while loop to guarantee that the substring is valid. 
On the other hand, when asked to find minimum substring, we should update minimum inside the inner while loop*
